# Project-2-
A local retail pharmacy called Pharma Lu has a database where they put data on stock received and dispensed to patients. Lately the pharmacy has been having issues with student mistakenly giving the patients prescription medicines instead of over the counter medicine. The pharmacy would like to have a dispensing system that can highlight to anyone dispensing medication if they are dispensing a prescription medicine to avoid any errors being made.A machine learning model was created that considers the features of a medicine (e.g.,Category, Dosage Form, Manufacturer), and predict whether it is a prescription or over the counter medication. This model will form a part of the dispensing system.
